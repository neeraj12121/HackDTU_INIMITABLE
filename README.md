Medical image analysis is an area which has witnessed an increased use of machine learning in recent times. In this ,we try to provide an overview of applications of machine learning techniques to medical skin problems. Health informatics is a relatively new area which deals with mining large amounts of data to gain useful insights. Some of the common challenges in health informatics will be briefly touched upon and some of the efforts in related directions will be outlined.
          Machine Learning (ML) aspires to provide computational methods for accumulating, updating and changing knowledge in the intelligent systems and particular learning mechanisms that assist to induce knowledge from the data. It is useful in cases where direct algorithmic solutions are unavailable, there is lack of formal models, or the knowledge about the application domain is inadequately defined
